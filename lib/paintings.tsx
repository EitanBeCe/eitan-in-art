I poured my heart into this beauty and spent a few sleepless nights with her (took me more than 12 hours total). It’s vibrant, pink, and even has a splash of vodka for that extra sparkle.

Here is some text from it (usually sing on Shabbat evening):

A woman of valor, who can find? Far beyond pearls is her value. Her husband’s heart trusts in her and he shall lack no fortune
...
False is grace, and vain is beauty; a G‑d-fearing woman, she should be praised.
Give her the fruit of her hands, and she will be praised at the gates by her very own deeds.
